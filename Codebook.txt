Codebook for tidydata.txt
=================

The original data comes from an experiment carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

For details on the data please see: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

Among all the statistics that were estimated for this set of variables, we only considered:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation


We then averaged them by subject and by activity to get the dataset tidydata.txt.

act_name: Its activity label. 
subject_id: An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
