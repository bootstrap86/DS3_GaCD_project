DS3_GaCD_project
================

This is the project assessment for Coursera'S Data Science Tack's "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

---------------------------------
There are 3 important files in this repo:
1. README.md:       is this document and explains what is in the repo and what the analysis does
2. Codebook.txt:    explains the variables in the analysis
3. run_analysis.R:  runs the analysis to complete the project
---------------------------------

The run_analysis.R-file does the following:
- Downloads data sets on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- Creates another independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
